# Cons of React

- GIANT LIBRARY

# Rebuilding Bookworm

- Original bookworm [https://bookworm.htrc.illinois.edu/develop/](https://bookworm.htrc.illinois.edu/develop/)
- Larger project with Hathi Trust, JSTOR, and Portico

---
# New Bookworm

- Built in VueJS
- Shared app between developers at UVA and JSTOR
- Also an app for searching repositories and bundling new datasets

---
# VueJS

- "Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable."
- Built by a small team [https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/team.html](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/team.html)
- Let's look at the docs [https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started)

---
# Pros of Vue

- Many of the same features as React (Components, JSX support, state management)
- Easier learning curve
- HTML Templates & Two Way Data Binding
- More flexibility on what you use in your project

# VueJS and Bookworm

- Vuetify [https://vuetifyjs.com/en/](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
